## Problem Statement

### Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the head modified list. k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then leave the remaining nodes as such they are present.

> Example 1:

```
Sample Input

List = [1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9]

k = 4

Sample Output

[4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 9]

```

> Example 2:

```
Sample Input

List = [1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6]

k = 3

Sample Output

[3 , 2 , 1 , 6 , 5 , 4]
```

> Constraints:

```
Let the number of the nodes in the list be n.

1 <= n <= 5000

```

## Solution

```java

```
