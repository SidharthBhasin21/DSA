### Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

> Example 1:

```
Input:

head = [-1, -1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]

Output:

[-1, 2, 3]

```

> Example 2:

```
Input:

head = [-1, 1, 2, 2]

Output:

[-1, 1, 2]

```

> Constraints:

```
-300 <= node value <= 300

Each list has atmost 100 nodes
```

## Solution

```java
public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) {

        ListNode temp = head;



    }
```
